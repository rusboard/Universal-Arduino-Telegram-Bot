#ESP8266 - Chat Title & Description for Groups & Channels

This is a basic example of how to use set chat title and description in groups using UniversalTelegramBot for ESP8266 based boards.
Set title: use this method to change the title of a chat. Titles can't be changed for private chats. The bot must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.
Set description: use this method to change the description of a supergroup or a channel. The bot must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.
